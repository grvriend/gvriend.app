# GrahamVriend.README

This is my leadership README, a written introduction to who I am, my leadership style, and my expectations.  Please treat this as a reference point on how I will behave as a leader.  This is a living document and I appreciate any feedback to improve it further.

## Who I am

### My family

I met my wife at [Dordt University](https://www.dordt.edu/) and we now have a six-year-old daughter.  Our daughter was born at 25 weeks and weighed less than a pound, changing our lives forever.  Although there have been many challenges, I am constantly reminded of miracles each day.  Being a father has taught me a lot about leadership and persistance.

### My home

My family lives in the small farming town of [Lynden, WA](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lynden,+WA+98264/@48.9644329,-122.4526089,14z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x5485b6fc63dc8e25:0xfe6124ff02d8e1ae!8m2!3d48.9428018!4d-122.4529469), about 10 minutes away from Canada.  This is where my wife grew up but also only an hour away from Vancouver, BC where I was born.

### My extroverted Personality

I am an extrovert that always wants to get out of the house and hang out with others.  After working remotely for 10 years, I still get some serious cases of cabin-fever.

### My love for travel

I love to travel, especially to places that I have never been to before.  I may not plan every detail of the trip, but pretty close.  I love to plan anything and travel scratches the itch.

### My work-life balance journey

I am always striving to improve my work-life balance.  With a remote office just a few steps away, working off-hours is tempting and something that I have previously struggled with.  I am doing my best to limit off-hours work as much as possible.

## What I do

### Technical strategy

As a member of the technical leadership team, we plan our long-term technical strategy and have ownership of technical initiatives for the department.  Depending on the initiative, this can either be a direct contributor-role where I get into the code myself or a delegator role where I work with others.

### Hiring engineers

I, and the other tech leads participate in the hiring process of software engineers.  We recognize that hiring can have a large impact on our squads and thus hire carefully.

### Technical help

I provide technical help to software engineers where needed.  Although I can provide help to engineers for all languages/applications in our stack, my specialty is the Coldfusion language and the reporting applications.

### Training/mentoring

I love to train and mentor others where needed.  If there is something you would like me to train or mentor you on, always feel free to ask me.

## Expectations

These are expectations that you can expect from me, and I would expect from you as well.

### Accountability

If you make a mistake, take responsibility for it.  If your team makes a mistake and it is not your fault, take responsibility for it anyway.  If I make mistake or if I veer away from the values in this document, please hold me accountable.

### Personal growth

We all have room for personal growth both technically and personally.  Incremental small improvements can build long term success, and there should always be signs that one is improving.  I value using the [Incremental Growth Leadership Model](https://tdevroome.medium.com/the-incremental-growth-leadership-model-cef736bebbff#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Iterative%20Leadership,their%20learning%20and%20career%20goals.) to coach and drive growth in others around me.

### Respect

I believe that respect is **NOT** something that needs to be earned.  Everyone is deserving of respect in all circumstances.

### Honesty

Any lie, withholding the truth, or misdirection will always come around to have a negative impact in the end.  From me, you expect the truth in our conversations.

### Availability

When not on vacation, I expect availability during business hours.  If you need to be gone for a period of time during the day please communicate.  Emails should be responded to every day, and chats should be responded to in less than a couple hours at most.

### Work ethic

Laziness and lack of focus will always end in a negative result.  Similar to a hockey player jumping on the ice to play, I expect a full energy and effort for your shift on the ice.

### Communication

Always communicate, over-communicate if necessary.  Avoid situations that surprise others.  Feedback is critical to success and should always be given, positive or negative.
